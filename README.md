# Service Communication  

This repository is a practical exploration of **service-to-service communication patterns** using key API paradigms:  

- **REST** → Resource-oriented APIs over HTTP/JSON.  
- **gRPC** → High-performance RPC framework using Protocol Buffers over HTTP/2.  
- **GraphQL** → Flexible query language for APIs that gives clients control over the data shape.  
- **WebSockets** → Real-time, bidirectional communication channel over a persistent TCP connection.  

The aim is to build **minimal, working implementations** of each style, compare their **architectures, serialization models, and performance trade-offs**, and understand when to choose one approach over another.  

This is not about production-ready code, but about gaining **hands-on insight into the mechanics of modern service communication**.
