# API Playground: REST, gRPC & GraphQL  

This repo is a small **playground to experiment with different service communication paradigms** â€” **REST** (resource-based APIs over HTTP/JSON), **gRPC** (RPC framework with Protocol Buffers over HTTP/2), and **GraphQL** (query language for flexible client-driven APIs).  

The goal is to **learn by building simple examples**, compare their differences, and understand the trade-offs of each approach to get better at **service-to-service communication design**.
